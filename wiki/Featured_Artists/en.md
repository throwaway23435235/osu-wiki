# Featured Artists

<!-- TODO: include some history about featured artists / mappers' guild, maybe in /History_of_osu! too -->

**Featured artists** are music artists that have worked with osu! to make a selection of their tracks available for unrestricted use in the community. Some of the featured artists have also composed tracks specifically for osu! and released them as osu! exclusives.

[A section of the website](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) lists and details each featured artist. On the artists' pages, you can find general information about them, as well as all of the tracks licensed for use in osu! accompanied by pre-timed `.osz` files for use in beatmapping.

## Mappers' Guild

To promote mapping featured artist content, members of the community created the **Mappers' Guild**, giving mappers an MMO-style quest system that they can participate in with other mappers. Rewards for being active in the guild include profile badges, early access to new featured artist content, and the ability to help decide which artists the osu! team should consider working with next.

More information about the Mappers' Guild can be found on [their website](http://mappersguild.com) and in the `#mappers-guild` channel of the [osu!dev Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ppy).
